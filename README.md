Best images we found: [133 ,176, 116, 37, 118, 128 , 26 ,124, 161, 32, 291, 267, 146, 114, 280, 206, 273, 287, 3, 252 ,11 ,15 , 184, 4 ,258, 126, 131, 34, 248, 201]
<br /><br />
tsne - clustering using t-sne <br />
For execute tsne Required to change 'root' variable to contain the path to 'monet_jpg' directory.

fid_selection - GA with FID as fitness function <br />
For execute fid_selection Required to change 'root' variable to contain the path to 'monet_jpg' directory.

style_transfer - Image generation with style transfer model <br />
For execute style_transfer  Required to change 'style_path' variable to contain the path to 'monet_jpg' directory and 'content_path' variable to contain the path to 'pohoto_jpg' directory. Also need to change the imsave path.

The other selection methods assume the code run over Google Colab platform. <br />
The training notebook assume the code run over Kaggle editor. In training we used own dataset - mymoet by Ido Ikar (public in kaggle).
 <br />
The inference notebook also required kaggle platform. It is simply because the data sets already there. (If it is critical to be in Google Colab, Contact us by email and we send Google Colab train/inference notebook) 
The inference notebook download the model and load the weights automatically. the model weights can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1x-WYimV_rUizK2zCwC1W-feQTw2vCqXH
 <br />
The notebook iterate over 8 images. To iterate more images, change the range in the for loop.
